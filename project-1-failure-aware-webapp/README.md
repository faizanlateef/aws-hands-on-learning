# Project 1 – Failure-Aware Scalable Web Application on AWS

## Why This Project Exists

The goal is to design, deploy, break, observe, and harden a real AWS-based
web application using production-style architecture and engineering decisions.

The focus is on understanding failure, not just making things work.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Multi-AZ VPC design
- Public and private subnet isolation
- Application Load Balancer
- Auto Scaling Groups
- Private EC2 application servers
- Controlled outbound internet access via NAT Gateway
- Health checks and traffic flow validation
- Failure analysis and resilience patterns
